        You have chosen to stay purple even though there are some risks involved.
        Luckily you end up meeting a Pegasus on your journey who loves the color
        purple. You two instantly hit it off and you guys start to talk about
        where you are heading. When you tell him that you are heading out of the
        forest he gets very excited because he is too! You guys realize that you
        can both finish your journeys together. He says that you guys can walk
        together or you can get on his back and he can fly you guys out of the
        forest. Which one would you like to do?
