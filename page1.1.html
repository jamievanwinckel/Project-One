        You chose to bring food and you have begun your journey. There is a river that you
        have to cross, so you start walking across it while holding the food up
        over your head. Unfortunately, the river is to deep and you cannot stand…
        So part of your food gets wet. Since your food is now soggy, you have two
        options. The first option is to find someone to trade with, this is a very
        good idea if you can find someone who will trade with you. The second
        option is to eat the food even though it is soggy, this is an okay decision
        if you don’t mind eating soggy food.
