        You chose food over seeds, so now that you have food you will not starve.
        Luckily, you still have extra money left and you are walking by another
        market. You happen to find a leprechaun there who desperately needs food.
        He doesn’t have money but he has two things he is offering to trade with
        you: magical crystals or some of his leprechaun eyelashes. Both of these
        have special powers: the magic crystals make you hyper (you won’t need to
        rest while traveling), and the leprechaun eyelashes let you see the future
        (you can change what actually happens after you see it).
