        Now that you have chosen to look for the solution, you resume your journey
        and keep your eye open. A little down the road you run into an ogre, now
        this all depends on how you act. If you respond to him correctly, then
        you guys could become friends and he will give you the solution. But if
        you respond incorrectly then he will go after you and you will have to
        run away from him. Which way do you want the ogre to react?
