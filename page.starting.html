        You are about to start your journey through the mystical forest, but
        first you must decide what you would like to carry with you just in case
        you need it. You can buy food and water, which you can carry very easily
        and always be supplied with your necessary survival needs. Or you can carry
        money, and you can choose as you go on the journey where you want to spend
        it. (It is easier to carry the money than the food and water, but bringing the
        food is the safest bet)
