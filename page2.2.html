        You chose to eat the soggy food, and it isnâ€™t until after you eat it that
        you realize you have been ripped off. The fox that you bought the food
        from put a chemical that makes your skin turn purple. This will not kill
        you, however no one in the forest ever helps someone that is purple. You
        can either go on a search for the solution to the purple skin or you can
        leave it and stay purple. The search might be long but if you find the
        solution it is worth it.
