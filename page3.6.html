        Now that you bought the leprechaun eyelashes that let you see the future
        you get to use them to decide where to go in the forest. You see that
        there is shelter in your near future, which means that you will be coming
        across a place to rest soon. You realize that it is probably either a
        castle or a cabin in the woods that you will rest at, so you have to
        decide which way to travel. The castle is further away, so there is more
        opportunity for something bad to happen. However, the cabins that are in
        the woods are sometimes dangerous to walk to. Which shelter do you want
        to walk towards?
