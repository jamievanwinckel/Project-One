      You chose to trade your food, so when you pass by a marketplace you stop
      and go in to see where you can trade it. You happen to find a leprechaun
      there who desperately needs food. He doesn’t have money but he has two things
      he is offering to trade with you: magical crystals or some of his leprechaun
      eyelashes. Both of these have special powers: the magic crystals make you
      hyper (you won’t need to rest while traveling), and the leprechaun eyelashes
      let you see the future (you can change what actually happens after you see it).
