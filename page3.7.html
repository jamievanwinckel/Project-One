        You planted the seeds and they grew into a delicious fruit plant. You
        don’t need food but you’re tempted to eat the fruit because it tastes
        so good. But if you save the food then you will be able to trade it with
        someone for valuable information that tells you exactly how to get out
        of the forest. Which one will you pick?
