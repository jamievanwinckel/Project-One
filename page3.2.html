      Now that you have chosen the leprechaun eyelashes, you are able to see what
       will happen in the future. You find out that along the way you will run
       into a magic carpet that you can take, and shortly after that you will
       run into a prince with a horse that will take you all the way out of the
       forest. You must choose now so that you can pick the one you prefer.
       So which one will it be?
