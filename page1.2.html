        You chose to bring money and you have begun your journey. You are walking
        and you come across a marketplace, so you figure that you should look and
        see if you can buy anything with your money. You see that you can buy food
        or seeds. The food is helpful for immediate use but the seeds are helpful
        for long term use of food. Which one are you going to buy?
