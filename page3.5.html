        Now that you bought the magical crystals that make you hyper, you get to
        decide if you eat the crystals or not. If you do eat them, then you will
        help the people that are carrying a lot of groceries to their cabin in
        the woods. And if you help the people, they will give you a hover machine
        that will guide you straight out of the mystical forest. But you can also
        save the crystals for another time when they might be more helpful. So,
        which one will it be?
