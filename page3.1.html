        Now that you have chosen the magic crystals, you are on your way trying
        to get to the end of the forest. You eat the crystals so that you have a
        plethora of energy. Once the crystals get into your system you need to
        make a decision on how you are going to get to the end. You can run
        through the forest because you have so much energy that you move really
        fast or you can swing off of the vines hanging from the large trees above
        you, similar to Tarzan.
